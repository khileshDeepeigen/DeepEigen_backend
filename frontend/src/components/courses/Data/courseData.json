        "question": "What was AI-1.0Z ML course in 2019?",
        "answer": "AI-1.0Z was first offered in June 2019. It was intended to be a 28 weeks mathematically rigorous course. The 2019 course covered several topics in Machine Learning with graduate level mathematical depth."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is AI-1.0Z ML course at present?",
        "answer": "The first 6 weeks content of the 2019 AI-1.0Z Machine Learning course has been expanded to 7 weeks, and is being offered 2020 onward to serve as a non-exhaustive (number of topics) course in machine learning.\nThis 7 weeks course serves as a prerequisite (for machine learning mathematics) for some of the Category-II courses being offered by Eigen AI Labs.\nThis course can be taken by registrants to get deeply trained machine learning mathematics to develop the ability to further read any book in machine learning. Once registrants go through the mathematical rigour of this short 7 weeks course, we are of the opinion that they will be ready to read and understand machine learning related books to futher expand their knowledge."
      },
      {
        "question": "What about some topics that are mentioned in introductory lectures?",
        "answer": "The lectures were recorded in 2019 with an intent of providing full course. Since the course has been shortened, in the lectures some of the topics from 2019 course will be mentioned (in terms of what will be covered in the course), but they are no longer the part of the course being offered."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I take longer duration to understand the content?",
        "answer": "This is a self-paced course. Typically it should not take you more than 3 months to complete the course. But you have 6 months from the date of registration to complete the course. Beyond that period, please check the details on the Access tab above."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are prerequisites?",
        "answer": "This course assumes that you have basic background knowledge of\nLinear Algebra\nProbability\n(Multivariate-) Calculus\nFurthermore, registrants are exptected to know at least one computer programming language. The assignments will be in Python, and thus, we expect the registrants to learn python programming concepts on their own.\nWe expect that the registrants can learn libraries like numpy on their own, and can implement mathematical programs using the python programming language."
